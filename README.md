# SortLinkedLists
This semester I am taking an introductory C++ class. One of the assignments is to sort some numbers.

Being an introductory course, it was implied that we should use arrays, and that was even the lesson for the day. The only problem with that is that I have years of experience with object oriented languages so I wouldn't learn anything. I have never used Linked Lists before, and I'm still pretty iffy with pointers in general so this is the perfect opportunity to finally learn something in this class.
