# SortLinkedLists
This semester I am taking an introductory C++ class. One of the assignments is to sort some numbers.

The first thing I noticed about this assignment was that it does not say anything the content that we were presented on the day this assignment was given out. Arrays. I have never used Linked Lists before, and I'm still pretty iffy with pointers in general. This is the perfect opportunity to finally learn something in this class.
